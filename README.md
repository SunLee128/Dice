# Dice
React app shakes two dice with a button. 
This is an example app on how to passing a state for parent as props.
It has two components
* RollDice - a parent component (rendered by App) that renders the dice and a button to roll.
* Die - an individual die that takes props and displays the correct face of the die based on props.
